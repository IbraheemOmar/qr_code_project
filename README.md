### What I learned

I was able to find the solution to a problem I was having with github. I was having trouble getting my images to display on my live github pages when keeping my images inside a folder. I looked to see if anyone on the discord server ran into a similar problem and someone mentioned that this was a filepath issue.

solution

The web page was unable to find the image because I was missing the dot. Unlike visual studio, Github will not recognize the image file path without a period at the beginning.
